# DotFlow — Roadmap

Working order agreed for the current arc. Check items off as they land; keep this file the single
source of truth for "what's next". Full context for each item lives in
[`SESSION-HANDOFF.md`](./SESSION-HANDOFF.md).

## Order

### 1. Typed text expander — backend (IN PROGRESS)

Type a dot-trigger (`.fu`) in **any** app → it's replaced by the saved phrase (the same library that
powers spoken triggers). Step 1 (safe foundation, off by default) is **done** (`8c4eb61`).

- [x] Step 1 — setting `experimental_typed_expander` (default OFF), self-injection suppression
      (`is_injecting()` / `InjectGuard`), pure tested core (`ExpanderBuffer`, `match_typed_trigger`).
- [x] Step 2/3 — Windows Raw Input keyboard monitor **implemented + live-validated**
      (`dotflow/typed_expander/backend.rs`). Smoke-tested by driving synthetic keystrokes into a separate
      window: typing `.fix` erased the trigger and pasted "Fix the bug where " (clipboard preserved), and a
      lone sentence period was left literal. Caught + fixed a real bug along the way (empty-key phrases made a
      bare `.` trigger — see below).
  - `RegisterRawInputDevices` (keyboard, `RIDEV_INPUTSINK`) + message-only hidden window + `WM_INPUT`
    pumped on a **dedicated native thread**; chars decoded with `ToUnicodeEx` + a tracked 256-key state.
  - Feed printable chars → `push`; Backspace → `backspace`; Enter/Tab/Esc/arrows/nav/Delete → `reset`;
    modifiers/lock/function keys → ignore (don't wipe an in-progress trigger).
  - On `matched()`: if `!is_injecting()`, raise `injection_guard()` → erase the `.key` via
    `inject_field_edit(n, "")` → paste the expansion via `inject_bulk` → `consume(n)`; a ~300 ms trailing
    **settle** window swallows the async `WM_INPUT` echoes of our own keystrokes so it can't re-trigger.
  - Injection guard made **re-entrant** (counter) so the outer emit guard + inner paste guard nest safely.
  - Start/stop the monitor thread on the setting toggle (`change_typed_expander_setting` command) and at
    boot when already on; UI toggle in Advanced → Experimental with an explicit "monitors your typing" note.
  - Windows-only; a `#[cfg]` stub keeps other platforms compiling (mac/Linux backends can slot in later).
  - **Bug fixed (found via smoke-test):** alias-only phrases are stored with `key = ""`, so `match_typed_trigger`
    built the trigger `".{key}" == "."` and expanded on **every lone period**. `PhraseTable::new` now drops
    empty keys (with a defensive guard in `match_typed_trigger`), fixing both the typed and spoken paths.
  - **Deviations from the original spec:** backspaces go through the tested `inject_field_edit` (enigo)
    rather than raw `SendInput`; self-suppression uses the guard + a time-based settle rather than HID-source
    filtering. **Known v1 limitation:** a trigger fires the instant it completes (`.fu` expands mid-word in
    `.fund`) — pick trigger keys that aren't word prefixes.

### 2. Housekeeping ✅

- [x] Disabled the noisy Handy CI workflows via `gh workflow disable` (not YAML edits, to avoid upstream-sync
      conflicts): `main-build`, `nix-check`, `playwright`, `build`, `build-test`, `pr-test-build`, `release`.
      Kept `code-quality` + `test`. Documented in `FORK.md` (§CI on the fork) with the re-enable command.
- [x] Upstream sync check (2026-07-07): `upstream/main` head is `0a59e1f` — the last sync point, so **no new
      commits to port**. Re-run `git fetch upstream && git log --oneline 0a59e1f..upstream/main` next week.

### 3. Premium redesign (expanded window) — good pause point (more polish possible later)

- [x] Surface-ladder look (off-white canvas → white panels → inset controls, green-biased hairlines, no
      shadows), Geist bundled font, emerald reserved for meaning, refined toggles/titlebar/inputs.
- [x] DotFlow-specific IA: grouped sidebar (DICTATE / REVIEW / SYSTEM) with Phrases elevated + emerald rail.
- [x] Trimmed model catalog (Parakeet V3/V2 · Whisper Small/Turbo/Large-v3 · Moonshine V2 streaming).
- [x] Super-compact "mini" bar tier; removed Handy donate + acknowledgements.
- [ ] _Optional future polish:_ deeper visual refinement (the design can still improve — paused here by
      choice to move to task 4). Remaining pages still on old tokens: History, Post-processing, Phrases,
      General, Debug (they work; not yet ladder-styled).

### 4. Clean-up-selected-text hotkey (IN PROGRESS)

- [ ] A 2nd hotkey that sends the SELECTED text to the post-process LLM (Ctrl+C → read clipboard → LLM
      cleanup prompt → paste result). Reuses existing post-processing + clipboard infra.

## Later / backlog

- Phone-as-microphone (LAN web page, QR pair, WebSocket audio → transcribe pipeline). Likely last.
